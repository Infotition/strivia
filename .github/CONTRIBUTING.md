# Contributing

**The issue tracker is only for bug reports and enhancement suggestions. If you have a question, please ask it in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/NpxrDGYDwV) instead of opening an issue.**

If you wish to contribute to the Strivia codebase or documentation, feel free to fork the repository and submit a
pull request. We use ESLint to enforce a consistent coding style, so having that set up in your editor of choice
is a great boon to your development process.

1. Fork & clone the repository, and make sure you're on the **main** branch
2. Run `npm start`
4. Code whatever you want and test it
6. Submit a pull request
